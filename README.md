Lorem Codesum is a theme tester for eleven different codes - once it works.
Turns out HTML is that kid who hears everything and takes it all literally. All of it.

Base concept came from my make-it-decaf project, a code switcher landing page with a customized theme.
Started this build in my cheatsheets file, as a simple reference, but it outgrew that so here we are.

At initial commit I am using the code-container structure from make-it-decaf,
swapped from pre alone to a pre/template combination,
built a safe and robust "torture template" for each language,
additional future-proofing with language name assignment in Javascript.

At time of transfer, HTML was not recognizing the Javascript file at all.
Plan is to use the original files in cheatsheets as backup while I troubleshoot here until it works.
