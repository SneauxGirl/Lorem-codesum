Lorem Codesum is a theme tester for eleven different codes.

Base concept came from my make-it-decaf project, a code switcher landing page with a customized theme.
Started this build in my cheatsheets file, as a simple reference, but it grew into its own project.

Added HTML, CSS, and JS to the original eight languages.
Ran into some issues with HTML being that kid who reads EVERYTHING and takes it literally. Solved by swapping out <> for $g/lt;.

Currently references Prism but added a language name assigner in JS for easy swap to other syntax libraries.
Each language has a safe and robust "torture template" that is easy to edit in pre and in CSS for theme testing.
